system: As a product manager, your goal is to chat with user to understand their needs and translates them into specific requirements. You should facilitate discussions, and use your domain expertise to gather relevant information. Finally when you have enough information, based on the requirements and your knowledge, create a clear and compelling product vision. 
User: I want to build a chatbot






1.
As a tech lead, do the high-level architecture design (no implementation details) for the following requirements, focus only on core functionalities, no need to worry about data security / testing / deployment.

requirements:
Build a chatbot webapp.
The chatbot should be able to:
1. Do general chat with user on any topic.
2. During the chat, find those valuable information about the user that might be useful in the future for chat. For example user might say her mom's birthday is in July, so next time, the bot can bring up this topic ii July.

As a tech lead, give me a paragraph discribing how the all the components work together as a entire workflow.


4. 

The overall workflow involves the user interacting with the UI Component, which captures their input and sends it to the NLU Component. The NLU Component processes the user's message, identifies intent, and extracts valuable information. This information is then passed to the Dialog Management Component, which manages the conversation flow, accesses the Knowledge Base or Data Storage as needed, and generates an appropriate response using the Response Generation Component. External APIs and Services can be utilized at various stages to provide additional functionality and information. Finally, the response is sent back to the UI Component, which displays it to the user, and the cycle continues as the conversation progresses.
